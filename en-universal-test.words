1	That

1	A

8	confronts

10	disaster
11	at
12	its
13	plant
14	in
15	Morris
16	,
17	Ill
18	.

1	After
2	an
3	explosion
4	idled
5	the
6	plant
7	in
8	June
9	,
10	the
11	company

15	to
16	within
17	12

20	completing
21	the
22	drawn-out
23	process
24	of
25	restarting
26	it
27	.

1	Then
2	a
3	second
4	explosion
5	occurred
6	.

1	Two
2	workers
3	died
4	and
5	six
6	remain
7	in
8	the
9	hospital
10	.

1	This
2	human
3	toll
4	adds
5	the
6	most
7	painful
8	dimension
9	yet
10	to
11	the
12	sudden
13	change
14	in
15	Quantum
16	's
17	fortunes
18	.

1	Until
2	this
3	year
4	,
5	the
6	company
7	had
8	been
9	steadily
10	lowering
11	its
12	accident
13	rate
14	and
15	picking
16	up
17	trade-group
18	safety
19	awards
20	.

1	A
2	prolonged
3	production
4	halt
5	at
6	the
7	plant
8	could
9	introduce
10	another
11	imponderable
12	into
13	Quantum
14	's
15	financial
16	future
17	.

1	When
2	a
3	plant
4	has
5	just
6	been
7	running
8	flat
9	out
10	to
11	meet
12	demand
13	,
14	calculating
15	lost
16	profit
17	and
18	thus
19	claims
20	under
21	business-interruption
22	insurance
23	is
24	straightforward
25	.

1	But
2	the
3	numbers
4	become
5	trickier
6	--
7	and
8	subject
9	to
10	dickering
11	between
12	insured
13	and
14	insurer
15	--
16	when
17	demand
18	is
19	shifting
20	.

1	Quantum

9	production
10	got
11	under

13	last

1	The

1	Not
2	everything
3	looks
4	grim
5	for
6	Quantum
7	.

1	The
2	plant
3	expansion
4	should

16	market
17	share
18	is
19	often
20	taken
21	through
22	sheer
23	capacity
24	.

1	By
2	lifting
3	ethylene
4	production
5	,
6	the
7	expansion
8	will
9	also
10	lower
11	the

8	in

10	after

10	share
11	is
12	now
13	estimated
14	to
15	be
16	12
17	%
18	.

1	While
2	the
3	Japanese
4	have
5	embraced
6	the
7	compact
8	packaging
9	and
10	convenience
11	of
12	concentrated
13	products
14	,
15	the
16	true
17	test
18	for

30	,
31	where
32	growth
33	is
34	slow
35	and
36	liquids
37	have
38	gained
39	prominence
40	over
41	powders
42	.

1	The
2	company
3	may
4	have
5	chosen
6	to
7	market
8	the
9	product
10	under
11	the
12	Cheer
13	name
14	since
15	it
16	's
17	already
18	expanded
19	its

21	Tide
22	into

34	Tide
35	with

37	.

1	With
2	superconcentrates
3	,
4	however
5	,
6	it
7	is
8	n't
9	always
10	easy
11	to
12	persuade
13	consumers
14	that
15	less
16	is
17	more
18	;
19	many
20	people
21	tend
22	to
23	dump
24	too
25	much
26	detergent
27	into
28	the
29	washing
30	machine
31	,
32	believing
33	that
34	it
35	takes
36	a
37	cup
38	of
39	powder
40	to
41	really
42	clean
43	the
44	laundry
45	.

1	In
2	the
3	early
4	1980s
5	,
6	P&G
7	tried
8	to
9	launch
10	here
11	a
12	concentrated
13	detergent
14	under
15	the
16	Ariel
17	brand
18	name
19	that
20	it
21	markets
22	in
23	Europe
24	.

1	But
2	the
3	product
4	,
5	which
6	was
7	n't
8	as
9	concentrated
10	as
11	the
12	new
13	Cheer
14	,
15	bombed
16	in
17	a
18	market
19	test
20	in
21	Denver
22	and
23	was
24	dropped
25	.

1	P&G
2	and
3	others
4	also
5	have
6	tried
7	repeatedly
8	to
9	hook
10	consumers
11	on
12	detergent
13	and
14	fabric
15	softener
16	combinations
17	in
18	pouches
19	,
20	but
21	they
22	have
23	n't
24	sold
25	well
26	,
27	despite
28	the
29	convenience
30	.

1	But
2	P&G
3	contends
4	the
5	new
6	Cheer
7	is
8	a
9	unique
10	formula
11	that
12	also
13	offers
14	an
15	ingredient
16	that
17	prevents
18	colors
19	from
20	fading
21	.

1	And
2	retailers
3	are
4	expected
5	to
6	embrace
7	the
8	product
9	,
10	in
11	part
12	because
13	it
14	will
15	take
16	up
17	less
18	shelf
19	space
20	.

1	``
2	When
3	shelf
4	space
5	was
6	cheap
7	,
8	bigger
9	was
10	better
11	,
12	''
13	says
14	Hugh
15	Zurkuhlen
16	,
17	an
18	analyst
19	at
20	Salomon
21	Bros
22	.

1	But
2	with
3	so
4	many
5	brands
6	vying
7	for
8	space
9	,
10	that
11	's
12	no
13	longer
14	the
15	case
16	.

1	If
2	the
3	new
4	Cheer
5	sells
6	well
7	,
8	the
9	trend
10	toward
11	smaller
12	packaging
13	is
14	likely
15	to
16	accelerate
17	as
18	competitors
19	follow
20	with
21	their
22	own
23	superconcentrates
24	.

1	Then
2	retailers
3	``
4	will
5	probably
6	push
7	the
8	{
9	less-established
10	}
11	brands
12	out
13	altogether
14	,
15	''
16	he
17	says
18	.

1	Competition
2	is
3	bound
4	to
5	get
6	tougher
7	if
8	Kao
9	introduces
10	a
11	product
12	like
13	Attack
14	in
15	the
16	U.S.
17	.

1	To
2	be
3	sure
4	,
5	Kao
6	would
7	n't
8	have
9	an
10	easy
11	time
12	taking
13	U.S.
14	market
15	share
16	away
17	from
18	the
19	mighty
20	P&G
21	,
22	which
23	has
24	about
25	23
26	%
27	of
28	the
29	market
30	.

1	Kao
2	officials
3	previously
4	have
5	said
6	they
7	are
8	interested
9	in
10	selling
11	detergents
12	in
13	the
14	U.S.
15	,
16	but
17	so
18	far
19	the
20	company
21	has
22	focused
23	on
24	acquisitions
25	,
26	such
27	as
28	last
29	year
30	's
31	purchase
32	of
33	Andrew
34	Jergens
35	Co.
36	,
37	a
38	Cincinnati
39	hand-lotion
40	maker
41	.

1	It
2	also
3	has
4	a
5	product-testing
6	facility
7	in
8	California
9	.

1	Some
2	believe
3	P&G
4	's
5	interest
6	in
7	a
8	superconcentrated
9	detergent
10	goes
11	beyond
12	the
13	concern
14	for
15	the
16	Japanese
17	.

1	``
2	This
3	is
4	something
5	P&G
6	would
7	do
8	with
9	or
10	without
11	Kao
12	,
13	''
14	says
15	Mr.
16	Zurkuhlen
17	.

1	With
2	economic
3	tension
4	between
5	the
6	U.S.
7	and
8	Japan
9	worsening
10	,
11	many
12	Japanese
13	had
14	feared
15	last
16	week
17	's
18	visit
19	from
20	U.S.
21	Trade
22	Representative
23	Carla
24	Hills
25	.

1	They
2	expected
3	a
4	new
5	barrage
6	of
7	demands
8	that
9	Japan
10	do
11	something
12	quickly
13	to
14	reduce
15	its
16	trade
17	surplus
18	with
19	the
20	U.S.
21	.

1	Instead
2	,
3	they
4	got
5	a
6	discussion
7	of
8	the
9	need
10	for
11	the
12	U.S.
13	and
14	Japan
15	to
16	work
17	together
18	and
19	of
20	the
21	importance
22	of
23	the
24	long-term
25	view
26	.

1	Mrs.
2	Hills
3	'
4	first
5	trip
6	to
7	Japan
8	as
9	America
10	's
11	chief
12	trade
13	negotiator
14	had
15	a
16	completely
17	different
18	tone
19	from
20	last
21	month
22	's
23	visit
24	by
25	Commerce
26	Secretary
27	Robert
28	A.
29	Mosbacher
30	.

1	Mr.
2	Mosbacher
3	called
4	for
5	concrete
6	results
7	by
8	next
9	spring
10	in
11	negotiations
12	over
13	fundamental
14	Japanese
15	business
16	practices
17	that
18	supposedly
19	inhibit
20	free
21	trade
22	.

1	He
2	said
3	such
4	results
5	should
6	be
7	``
8	measurable
9	in
10	dollars
11	and
12	cents
13	''
14	in
15	reducing
16	the
17	U.S.
18	trade
19	deficit
20	with
21	Japan
22	.

1	But
2	Mrs.

4	,
5	speaking
6	at
7	a
8	breakfast

10	of
11	the

13	Chamber
14	of
15	Commerce
16	in
17	Japan
18	on
19	Saturday
20	,
21	stressed
22	that
23	the
24	objective
25	``
26	is
27	not
28	to
29	get
30	definitive
31	action
32	by
33	spring

35	summer
36	,
37	it
38	is
39	rather
40	to
41	have
42	a
43	blueprint
44	for
45	action
46	.
47	''

1	She
2	added
3	that

8	to
9	have
10	a

33	''

1	How
2	such
3	remarks
4	translate
5	into
6	policy
7	wo
8	n't
9	become
10	clear
11	for
12	months
13	.

1	American
2	and
3	Japanese
4	officials
5	offered
6	several
7	theories
8	for
9	the
10	difference
11	in
12	approach
13	betwen
14	Mr.
15	Mosbacher
16	and
17	Mrs.
18	Hills
19	.

1	Many
2	called
3	it
4	simply
5	a
6	contrast
7	in
8	styles
9	.

1	But
2	some
3	saw
4	it
5	as
6	a
7	classic
8	negotiating
9	tactic
10	.

1	Others
2	said
3	the

10	on

15	out
16	of

18	.

1	And
2	some

1	When
2	she
3	met
4	the
5	local
6	press
7	for
8	the
9	first
10	time
11	on
12	Friday
13	,
14	Mrs.
15	Hills
16	firmly
17	reiterated
18	the
19	need
20	for
21	progress
22	in
23	removing
24	barriers
25	to
26	trade
27	in

1	She
2	highlighted

4	business
5	practices
6	that
7	the
8	U.S.
9	government
10	has
11	identified
12	.

1	But
2	her
3	main
4	thrust
5	was
6	to
7	promote
8	the
9	importance
10	of
11	world-wide
12	free
13	trade
14	and
15	open
16	competition
17	.

1	She
2	said
3	the
4	trade
5	imbalance
6	was
7	mainly
8	due
9	to
10	macroeconomic
11	factors

1	``

8	,
9	at
10	least
11	among
12	some
13	U.S.

15	,
16	about

24	access
25	to
26	the

1	The

8	has
9	been
10	stuck
11	around
12	10
13	%
14	for

16	.

1	Many
2	Americans
3	have
4	interpreted
5	a

8	as
9	assuring

12	a
13	20

20	the

1	The

9	a

11	openly

1	However

27	the

30	.

1	Ideal
2	Basic
3	Industries
4	Inc.
5	said
6	its
7	directors
8	reached
9	an
10	agreement
11	in
12	principle
13	calling
14	for
15	HOFI

18	Inc.
19	to

25	holdings
26	with
27	Ideal
28	in
29	a
30	transaction
31	that
32	will
33	leave
34	Ideal
35	's
36	minority
37	shareholders
38	with
39	12.8
40	%
41	of
42	the
43	combined
44	company
45	.

1	HOFI
2	,
3	the
4	North
5	American
6	holding
7	company
8	of
9	Swiss
10	concern
11	Holderbank
12	Financiere
13	Glaris
14	Ltd.
15	,
16	previously
17	proposed
18	combining
19	its
20	100
21	%
22	stake
23	in
24	St.

29	its

36	Co.
37	with
38	its
39	67
40	%
41	stake
42	in
43	Ideal
44	.

1	But
2	HOFI
3	's
4	first
5	offer
6	would
7	have
8	given
9	Ideal
10	's
11	other
12	shareholders
13	about
14	10
15	%
16	of
17	the
18	combined
19	company
20	.

1	Ideal
2	's
3	directors
4	rejected
5	that
6	offer
7	,
8	although
9	they
10	said
11	they
12	endorsed
13	the
14	merger
15	proposal
16	.

1	Under
2	the
3	agreement
4	,
5	HOFI
6	will
7	own
8	87.2
9	%
10	of
11	the
12	combined

14	.

1	Ideal
2	's
3	current

5	will
6	represent
7	about
8	39.2
9	%
10	of
11	the
12	combined
13	company
14	.

1	The
2	transaction
3	is
4	subject
5	to
6	a
7	definitive
8	agreement
9	and
10	approval
11	by
12	Ideal
13	shareholders
14	.

1	Ideal
2	said
3	it
4	expects
5	to
6	complete
7	the
8	transaction
9	early
10	next
11	year
12	.

1	While
2	corn
3	and
4	soybean
5	prices
6	have
7	slumped
8	well
9	below
10	their
11	drought-induced
12	peaks
13	of
14	1988
15	,
16	wheat
17	prices
18	remain
19	stubbornly
20	high
21	.

1	And
2	they
3	're
4	likely
5	to
6	stay
7	that
8	way
9	for
10	months
11	to
12	come
13	,
14	analysts
15	say
16	.

1	For
2	one
3	thing
4	,
5	even
6	with
7	many
8	farmers
9	planting
10	more
11	winter
12	wheat
13	this
14	year
15	than
16	last
17	,
18	tight
19	wheat
20	supplies
21	are
22	likely
23	to
24	support
25	prices
26	well
27	into
28	1990
29	,
30	the
31	analysts
32	say
33	.

1	And
2	if
3	rain
4	does
5	n't
6	fall
7	soon
8	across
9	many
10	of
11	the
12	Great
13	Plains
14	'
15	wheat-growing
16	areas
17	,
18	yields
19	in
20	the
21	crop
22	now
23	being
24	planted
25	could
26	be
27	reduced
28	,
29	further
30	squeezing
31	supplies
32	.

1	Also
2	supporting
3	prices
4	are
5	expectations
6	that
7	the
8	Soviet
9	Union
10	will
11	place
12	substantial
13	buying
14	orders
15	over
16	the
17	next
18	few
19	months
20	.

1	By

5	,
6	stocks
7	of

9	wheat
10	to
11	be

18	--
19	before
20	the

22	wheat
23	now

27	harvested
28	--
29	are
30	projected
31	to
32	drop
33	to
34	443
35	million
36	bushels
37	.

1	That
2	would
3	be
4	the
5	lowest
6	level
7	since
8	the
9	early
10	1970s
11	.

1	Stocks
2	were
3	698
4	million
5	bushels
6	on
7	May
8	31
9	of
10	this

1	In
2	response
3	to
4	dwindling
5	domestic
6	supplies
7	,
8	Agriculture
9	Secretary
10	Clayton
11	Yeutter
12	last
13	month
14	said
15	the
16	U.S.
17	government
18	would
19	slightly
20	increase
21	the
22	number
23	of
24	acres
25	farmers
26	can
27	plant
28	in
29	wheat
30	for
31	next
32	year
33	and
34	still
35	qualify
36	for
37	federal
38	support
39	payments
40	.

1	The
2	government
3	estimates
4	that
5	the
6	new
7	plan
8	will
9	boost
10	production
11	next
12	year
13	by
14	about
15	66
16	million
17	bushels
18	.

1	It
2	now
3	estimates
4	production
5	for
6	next
7	year
8	at
9	just
10	under
11	2.6
12	billion
13	bushels
14	,
15	compared
16	with
17	this
18	year
19	's
20	estimated
21	2.04
22	billion
23	and
24	a
25	drought-stunted
26	1.81
27	billion
28	in
29	1988
30	.

1	But
2	the
3	full
4	effect
5	on
6	prices
7	of
8	the
9	winter
10	wheat
11	now
12	being
13	planted
14	wo
15	n't
16	be
17	felt
18	until
19	the
20	second
21	half
22	of
23	next
24	year
25	.

1	Until
2	then
3	,
4	limited
5	stocks
6	are
7	likely
8	to
9	keep
10	prices
11	near
12	the
13	$
14	4-a-bushel
15	level
16	,
17	analysts
18	say
19	.

1	On
2	the
3	Chicago
4	Board
5	of
6	Trade
7	Friday
8	,
9	wheat
10	for

14	at
15	$
16	4.0675
17	a
18	bushel
19	,
20	unchanged
21	.

1	In
2	theory
3	at
4	least
5	,
6	tight
7	supplies
8	next
9	spring
10	could
11	leave
12	the
13	wheat
14	futures
15	market
16	susceptible
17	to
18	a
19	supply-demand
20	squeeze
21	,
22	said
23	Daniel
24	Basse
25	,
26	a
27	futures
28	analyst
29	with
30	AgResource
31	Co.
32	in
33	Chicago
34	.

1	Such
2	a
3	situation
4	can
5	wreak
6	havoc
7	,
8	as
9	was
10	shown
11	by
12	the

14	that

1	The
2	exchange
3	said
4	it
5	feared
6	that
7	some

9	would
10	n't
11	be
12	able
13	to
14	find
15	enough
16	soybeans
17	to
18	deliver
19	and
20	would
21	have

24	on
25	their
26	contractual
27	obligation
28	to
29	the

1	For
2	the
3	first
4	time
5	,
6	the
7	83-year-old
8	justice
9	finds
10	his
11	influence
12	almost
13	exclusively
14	in
15	dissent
16	,
17	rather
18	than
19	as
20	a
21	force
22	in
23	the
24	high
25	court
26	's
27	majority
28	.

1	This
2	role
3	reversal
4	holds
5	true
6	,
7	as
8	well
9	,
10	for
11	his
12	three
13	liberal
14	and

19	Thurgood
20	Marshall
21	,
22	Harry
23	Blackmun
24	and

27	.

1	But
2	are
3	these
4	four
5	players
6	,
7	three
8	of
9	them
10	in
11	their
12	80s
13	,
14	ready
15	to
16	assume
17	a
18	different
19	role
20	after
21	88
22	years
23	,
24	collectively
25	,
26	of
27	service
28	on
29	the
30	high
31	court
32	?

1	Every
2	indication
3	is
4	that
5	the
6	four
7	are
8	prepared
9	to
10	accept
11	this
12	new
13	role
14	,
15	and
16	the
17	frustrations
18	that
19	go
20	with
21	it
22	,
23	but
24	in
25	different
26	ways
27	.

1	Justices
2	Brennan
3	and
4	Stevens
5	appear
6	philosophical
7	about
8	it
9	;
10	Justices
11	Marshall
12	and
13	Blackmun
14	appear
15	fighting
16	mad
17	.

1	The
2	four
3	justices
4	are
5	no
6	newcomers
7	to
8	dissent
9	,
10	often
11	joining
12	forces
13	in
14	the
15	past
16	decade
17	to
18	criticize
19	the
20	court
21	's
22	conservative
23	drift
24	.

1	But
2	always
3	,
4	in
5	years
6	past
7	,
8	they
9	have
10	bucked
11	the
12	trend
13	and
14	have
15	been
16	able
17	to
18	pick
19	up
20	a
21	fifth
22	vote
23	to
24	eke
25	out
26	a
27	number
28	of
29	major
30	victories
31	in
32	civil
33	rights
34	and
35	liberties
36	cases
37	.

1	Now
2	,
3	however
4	,
5	as
6	the
7	court
8	's
9	new
10	five-member
11	conservative
12	majority
13	continues
14	to
15	solidify
16	,
17	victories
18	for
19	the
20	liberals
21	are
22	rare
23	.

1	The
2	change
3	is
4	most
5	dramatic
6	for
7	Justice
8	Brennan
9	,
10	the
11	last
12	survivor
13	of
14	the
15	mid-1960s
16	liberal
17	majority

1	Justice
2	Blackmun
3	,
4	who
5	will
6	turn
7	81
8	next
9	month
10	,
11	also
12	seems
13	feisty
14	about
15	his
16	new
17	role
18	.

1	Associates
2	say
3	he
4	takes
5	some
6	defeats
7	more
8	personally
9	than
10	his
11	colleagues
12	,
13	especially
14	attempts
15	to
16	curtail
17	the
18	right
19	to
20	abortion
21	first
22	recognized
23	in
24	his
25	1973
26	opinion
27	,
28	Roe
29	vs.
30	Wade
31	.

1	Friends
2	and
3	associates
4	who
5	saw
6	Justice
7	Blackmun
8	during
9	the
10	summer
11	said
12	he
13	was
14	no
15	more
16	discouraged
17	about
18	the
19	court
20	than
21	in
22	recent
23	years
24	.

1	And
2	his
3	outlook
4	improved
5	after
6	successful
7	cataract
8	surgery
9	in
10	August
11	.

1	But
2	his
3	level
4	of
5	frustration
6	showed
7	in
8	a
9	recent
10	,
11	impassioned
12	speech
13	to
14	a
15	group
16	of
17	hundreds
18	of
19	lawyers
20	in
21	Chicago
22	.

1	He
2	concluded
3	his
4	remarks
5	by
6	quoting
7	,
8	emotionally
9	and
10	at
11	some
12	length
13	,
14	according
15	to
16	those
17	present
18	,
19	the
20	late
21	Martin
22	Luther
23	King
24	's
25	famous
26	``
27	I
28	Have
29	a
30	Dream
31	''
32	speech
33	from
34	the
35	1963
36	March
37	on
38	Washington
39	.

1	Justice
2	Stevens
3	,
4	69
5	,
6	is
7	probably
8	the
9	most
10	philosophical
11	of
12	the
13	dissenters
14	about
15	his
16	role
17	,
18	in
19	part
20	because
21	he
22	may
23	be
24	the
25	least
26	liberal
27	of
28	the
29	four
30	,
31	but
32	also
33	because
34	he
35	enjoys
36	the
37	intellectual
38	challenge
39	of
40	arguing
41	with
42	the
43	majority
44	more
45	than
46	the
47	others
48	.

1	If
2	the
3	role
4	these
5	four
6	dissenters
7	are
8	assuming
9	is
10	a
11	familiar
12	one
13	in
14	modern
15	Supreme
16	Court
17	history
18	,
19	it
20	also
21	differs
22	in
23	an
24	important
25	way
26	from
27	recent
28	history
29	,
30	court
31	watchers
32	say
33	.

1	``
2	The
3	dissenters
4	of
5	the
6	Warren
7	Court
8	were
9	often
10	defending
11	a
12	legal
13	legacy
14	that
15	they
16	inherited

27	of

31	,
32	``
33	but
34	the
35	dissenters
36	today
37	are
38	defending
39	a
40	legacy
41	that
42	they
43	created
44	.

1	The
2	government
3	sold
4	the
5	deposits
6	of
7	four
8	savings-and-loan
9	institutions
10	,
11	in
12	its
13	first
14	wave
15	of
16	sales
17	of
18	big
19	,
20	sick
21	thrifts
22	,
23	but
24	low
25	bids
26	prevented
27	the
28	sale
29	of
30	a
31	fifth
32	.

1	The
2	four
3	S&Ls
4	were
5	sold
6	to
7	large
8	banks
9	,
10	as
11	was
12	the
13	case
14	with
15	most
16	of
17	the
18	28
19	previous
20	transactions
21	initiated
22	by
23	the
24	Resolution
25	Trust
26	Corp.
27	since
28	it
29	was
30	created
31	in
32	the
33	S&L
34	bailout
35	legislation
36	two
37	months
38	ago
39	.

1	Two
2	of
3	the
4	four
5	big
6	thrifts
7	were
8	sold
9	to
10	NCNB
11	Corp.
12	,
13	Charlotte
14	,
15	N.C.
16	,
17	which
18	has
19	aggressively
20	expanded
21	its
22	markets
23	,
24	particularly
25	in
26	Texas
27	and
28	Florida
29	.

1	A
2	Canadian
3	bank
4	bought
5	another
6	thrift
7	,
8	in
9	the
10	first
11	RTC
12	transaction
13	with
14	a
15	foreign
16	bank
17	.

1	Under
2	these
3	deals
4	,
5	the
6	RTC
7	sells
8	just
9	the
10	deposits
11	and
12	the
13	healthy
14	assets
15	.

1	These
2	``
3	clean-bank
4	''
5	transactions
6	leave
7	the
8	bulk
9	of
10	bad
11	assets
12	,
13	mostly
14	real
15	estate
16	,
17	with
18	the
19	government
20	,
21	to
22	be
23	sold
24	later
25	.

1	In
2	these
3	four
4	,
5	for
6	instance
7	,
8	the
9	RTC
10	is
11	stuck
12	with
13	$
14	4.51
15	billion
16	in
17	bad
18	assets
19	.

1	Acquirers
2	paid
3	premiums
4	ranging
5	from
6	1.5
7	%
8	to
9	3.7
10	%
11	for
12	the
13	deposits
14	and
15	branch
16	systems
17	,
18	roughly
19	in
20	line
21	with
22	what
23	analysts
24	were
25	expecting
26	.

1	The
2	buyers
3	will
4	also
5	be
6	locked
7	into
8	deposit
9	rates
10	for
11	just
12	two
13	weeks
14	,
15	as
16	has
17	been
18	the
19	case
20	with
21	previous
22	deals
23	.

1	After
2	that
3	,
4	the
5	buyers
6	may
7	repudiate
8	the
9	rates
10	paid
11	by
12	the
13	former
14	thrifts
15	.

1	But
2	it
3	's
4	uncertain
5	whether
6	these
7	institutions
8	will
9	take
10	those
11	steps
12	.

1	NCNB
2	,
3	for
4	example
5	,
6	has
7	been
8	one
9	of
10	the
11	highest
12	rate
13	payers
14	in
15	the
16	Texas
17	market
18	,
19	and
20	in
21	Florida
22	,
23	rates
24	are
25	especially
26	sensitive
27	in
28	retirement
29	communities
30	.

1	The
2	RTC
3	had
4	previously
5	targeted
6	five
7	thrifts
8	for
9	quick
10	sales
11	in
12	order
13	to
14	spend
15	cash
16	by
17	certain
18	budgetary
19	deadlines
20	,
21	but
22	the
23	delays
24	illustrate
25	the
26	tough
27	chore
28	facing
29	the
30	agency
31	.

3	rule
4	of

6	law
7	applied
8	to
9	both

11	was
12	that

20	the

3	the

5	in

8	is
9	the
10	same
11	.

1	But
2	the
3	outcome

1	Many
2	interpret

1	While
2	some
3	in
4	the
5	U.S.
6	contend
7	that
8	advertising
9	is
10	the
11	bane
12	of
13	television
14	,
15	here
16	many
17	believe
18	that
19	its
20	absence
21	is
22	to
23	blame
24	for
25	the
26	European
27	TV
28	industry
29	's
30	sluggish
31	development
32	.

1	Until
2	recently
3	,
4	national
5	governments
6	in
7	Europe
8	controlled
9	most
10	of
11	the
12	air
13	time
14	and
15	allowed
16	little
17	or
18	no
19	advertising
20	.

1	Since
2	production
3	costs
4	were
5	guaranteed
6	,
7	it
8	did
9	n't
10	matter
11	that
12	a
13	program
14	could
15	n't
16	be
17	sold
18	abroad
19	or
20	put
21	into
22	syndication
23	,
24	as
25	most
26	American
27	programs
28	are
29	.

1	But
2	not
3	much
4	money
5	was
6	spent
7	on
8	the
9	shows
10	,
11	either
12	,
13	a
14	situation
15	that
16	encouraged
17	cheap-to-make
18	talk
19	and
20	game
21	shows
22	,
23	while
24	discouraging
25	expensive-to-produce
26	dramas
27	.

1	Now
2	,
3	however
4	,
5	commercial
6	channels
7	are
8	coming
9	to
10	most
11	European
12	countries
13	,
14	and
15	at
16	the
17	same
18	time
19	,
20	satellite
21	and
22	cable
23	technology
24	is
25	spreading
26	rapidly
27	.

1	Just
2	last
3	week
4	,
5	Greece
6	authorized
7	two
8	commercial
9	channels
10	for
11	the
12	first
13	time
14	;
15	Spain
16	earlier
17	began
18	to
19	allow
20	commercial
21	television
22	alongside
23	its
24	state
25	channels
26	.

1	The
2	result
3	is
4	a
5	new
6	and
7	huge
8	appetite
9	for

11	.

1	But
2	perhaps
3	to
4	the
5	consternation
6	of
7	those
8	calling
9	for
10	quotas
11	,
12	most
13	of
14	this
15	void
16	is
17	likely
18	to
19	be
20	filled

1	While
2	the

1	Companies
2	will
3	continue
4	to
5	war
6	over
7	standards
8	.

1	In
2	computer
3	publishing
4	,
5	a
6	battle
7	over
8	typefaces
9	is
10	hurting
11	Adobe
12	Systems
13	Inc.
14	,
15	which
16	sells
17	software
18	that
19	controls
20	the
21	image
22	produced
23	by

25	and
26	displays
27	.

1	Until

4	Adobe
5	had
6	a
7	lock
8	on
9	the
10	market
11	for
12	image

14	,
15	but
16	last

18	Apple
19	,
20	Adobe
21	's
22	biggest

24	,
25	and
26	Microsoft
27	rebelled
28	.

1	Now
2	the
3	two
4	firms
5	are
6	collaborating
7	on
8	an
9	alternative
10	to
11	Adobe
12	's
13	approach
14	,
15	and
16	analysts
17	say
18	they
19	are
20	likely
21	to
22	carry
23	IBM

4	for
5	Adobe

20	of
21	low-end
22	printers
23	sold
24	by
25	Apple
26	.

1	The
2	program
3	is
4	aimed
5	at
6	improving
7	the
8	quality
9	of
10	printed
11	material
12	.

11	the
12	most
13	troublesome
14	right
15	now
16	?

1	A
2	good
3	bet
4	would
5	be
6	the
7	tension
8	between
9	blacks
10	and
11	Jews
12	in
13	New
14	York
15	City
16	.

1	Or
2	so
3	it
4	must
5	seem
6	to
7	Jackie
8	Mason
9	,
10	the
11	veteran
12	Jewish
13	comedian
14	appearing
15	in
16	a
17	new
18	ABC
19	sitcom
20	airing
21	on
22	Tuesday
23	nights
24	(
25	9:30-10
26	p.m.
27	EDT
28	)
29	.

1	Not
2	only
3	is
4	Mr.
5	Mason
6	the
7	star
8	of
9	``
10	Chicken
11	Soup
12	,
13	''
14	he
15	's
16	also
17	the
18	inheritor
19	of
20	a
21	comedic
22	tradition
23	dating
24	back
25	to
26	``
27	Duck
28	Soup
29	,
30	''
31	and
32	he
33	's
34	currently
35	a
36	man
37	in
38	hot
39	water
40	.

1	Here
2	,
3	in
4	neutral
5	language
6	,
7	is
8	the
9	gist
10	of
11	Mr.
12	Mason
13	's
14	remarks
15	,
16	quoted
17	first
18	in
19	the
20	Village
21	Voice
22	while
23	he
24	was
25	a
26	paid
27	spokesman
28	for
29	the
30	Rudolph
31	Giuliani
32	mayoral
33	campaign
34	,
35	and
36	then
37	in
38	Newsweek
39	after
40	he
41	and
42	the
43	campaign
44	parted
45	company
46	.

1	Mr.
2	Mason
3	said
4	that
5	many
6	Jewish
7	voters
8	feel
9	guilty
10	toward
11	blacks
12	,
13	so
14	they
15	support
16	black
17	candidates
18	uncritically
19	.

1	He
2	said
3	that
4	many
5	black
6	voters
7	feel
8	bitter
9	about
10	racial
11	discrimination
12	,
13	so
14	they
15	,
16	too
17	,
18	support
19	black
20	candidates
21	uncritically
22	.

1	He
2	said
3	that
4	Jews
5	have
6	contributed
7	more
8	to
9	black
10	causes
11	over
12	the
13	years
14	than
15	vice
16	versa
17	.

1	Of
2	course
3	,
4	Mr.
5	Mason
6	did
7	not
8	use
9	neutral
10	language
11	.

1	As
2	a
3	practitioner
4	of
5	ethnic
6	humor
7	from
8	the
9	old
10	days
11	on
12	the
13	Borscht
14	Belt
15	,
16	live
17	television
18	and
19	the
20	nightclub
21	circuit
22	,
23	Mr.
24	Mason
25	instinctively
26	reached
27	for
28	the
29	vernacular
30	.

1	He
2	said
3	Jews
4	were
5	``
6	sick
7	with
8	complexes
9	''
10	;
11	and
12	he
13	called
14	David
15	Dinkins
16	,
17	Mr.
18	Giuliani
19	's
20	black
21	opponent
22	,
23	``
24	a
25	fancy
26	shvartze
27	with
28	a
29	mustache
30	.
31	''

1	If
2	Mr.
3	Mason
4	had
5	used
6	less
7	derogatory
8	language
9	to
10	articulate
11	his
12	amateur
13	analysis
14	of
15	the
16	voting
17	behavior
18	of
19	his
20	fellow
21	New
22	Yorkers
23	,
24	would
25	the
26	water
27	be
28	quite
29	so
30	hot
31	?

1	It
2	probably
3	would
4	,
5	because
6	few
7	or
8	none
9	of
10	the
11	people
12	upset
13	by
14	Mr.
15	Mason
16	's
17	remarks
18	have
19	bothered
20	to
21	distinguish
22	between
23	the
24	substance
25	of
26	his
27	comments
28	and
29	the
30	fact
31	that
32	he
33	used
34	insulting
35	language
36	.

1	In
2	addition
3	,
4	some
5	of
6	Mr.
7	Mason
8	's
9	critics
10	have
11	implied
12	that
13	his
14	type
15	of
16	ethnic
17	humor
18	is
19	itself
20	a
21	form
22	of
23	racism
24	.

1	For
2	example
3	,
4	the
5	New
6	York
7	state
8	counsel
9	for
10	the
11	NAACP
12	said
13	that
14	Mr.
15	Mason
16	is
17	``
18	like
19	a
20	dinosaur
21	.

1	People
2	are
3	fast
4	leaving
5	the
6	place
7	where
8	he
9	is
10	stuck
11	.
12	''

1	These
2	critics
3	fail
4	to
5	distinguish
6	between
7	the
8	type
9	of
10	ethnic
11	humor
12	that
13	aims
14	at
15	disparaging
16	another
17	group
18	,
19	such
20	as
21	``
22	Polish
23	jokes
24	''
25	;
26	and
27	the
28	type
29	that
30	is
31	double-edged
32	,
33	aiming
34	inward
35	as
36	well
37	as
38	outward
39	.

1	The
2	latter
3	typically
4	is
5	the
6	humor
7	of
8	the
9	underdog
10	,
11	and
12	it
13	was
14	perfected
15	by
16	both
17	blacks
18	and
19	Jews
20	on
21	the
22	minstrel
23	and
24	vaudeville
25	stage
26	as
27	a
28	means
29	of
30	mocking
31	their
32	white
33	and
34	gentile
35	audiences
36	along
37	with
38	themselves
39	.

1	In
2	the
3	hands
4	of
5	a
6	zealot
7	like
8	Lenny
9	Bruce
10	,
11	this
12	double-edged
13	blade
14	could
15	cut
16	both
17	the
18	self
19	and
20	the
21	audience
22	to
23	ribbons
24	.

1	But
2	wielded
3	by
4	a
5	pro
6	like
7	Jackie
8	Mason
9	,
10	it
11	is
12	a
13	constructive
14	form
15	of
16	mischief
17	.

1	Why
2	constructive
3	?

1	Because
2	despite
3	all
4	the
5	media
6	prattle
7	about
8	comedy
9	and
10	politics
11	not
12	mixing
13	,
14	they
15	are
16	similar
17	in
18	one
19	respect
20	:
21	Both
22	can
23	serve
24	as
25	mechanisms
26	for
27	easing
28	tensions
29	and
30	facilitating
31	the
32	co-existence
33	of
34	groups
35	in
36	conflict
37	.

1	That
2	's
3	why
4	it
5	's
6	dangerous
7	to
8	have
9	well-intentioned
10	thought
11	police
12	,
13	on
14	college
15	campuses
16	and
17	elsewhere
18	,
19	taboo
20	all
21	critical
22	mention
23	of
24	group
25	differences
26	.

1	As
2	Elizabeth
3	Kristol
4	wrote
5	in
6	the
7	New
8	York
9	Times
10	just
11	before
12	the
13	Mason
14	donnybrook
15	,
16	``
17	Perhaps
18	intolerance
19	would
20	not
21	boil
22	over
23	with
24	such
25	intensity
26	if
27	honest
28	differences
29	were
30	allowed
31	to
32	simmer
33	.
34	''

1	The
2	question
3	is
4	,
5	if
6	group
7	conflicts
8	still
9	exist
10	(
11	as
12	undeniably
13	they
14	do
15	)
16	,
17	and
18	if
19	Mr.
20	Mason
21	's
22	type
23	of
24	ethnic
25	humor
26	is
27	passe
28	,
29	then
30	what
31	other
32	means
33	do
34	we
35	have
36	for
37	letting
38	off
39	steam
40	?

1	Do
2	n't
3	say
4	the
5	TV
6	sitcom
7	,
8	because
9	that
10	happens
11	to
12	be
13	a
14	genre
15	that
16	,
17	in
18	its
19	desperate
20	need
21	to
22	attract
23	everybody
24	and
25	offend
26	nobody
27	,
28	resembles
29	politics
30	more
31	than
32	it
33	does
34	comedy
35	.

1	It
2	is
3	true
4	that
5	the
6	best
7	sitcoms
8	do
9	allow
10	group
11	differences
12	to
13	simmer
14	:
15	yuppies
16	vs.
17	blue-collar
18	Bostonians
19	in
20	``
21	Cheers
22	''
23	;
24	children
25	vs.
26	adults
27	in
28	``
29	The
30	Cosby
31	Show
32	.
33	''

1	But
2	these
3	are
4	not
5	the
6	differences
7	that
8	make
9	headlines
10	.

1	In
2	``
3	Chicken
4	Soup
5	,
6	''
7	Mr.
8	Mason
9	plays
10	Jackie
11	,
12	a
13	Jewish
14	bachelor
15	courting
16	Maddie
17	(
18	Lynn
19	Redgrave
20	)
21	,
22	an
23	Irish
24	widow
25	and
26	mother
27	of
28	three
29	,
30	against
31	the
32	wishes
33	of
34	his
35	mother
36	(
37	Rita
38	Karin
39	)
40	and
41	her
42	brother
43	Michael
44	(
45	Brandon
46	Maggart
47	)
48	.

1	It
2	's
3	worth
4	noting
5	that
6	both
7	disapproving
8	relatives
9	are
10	immigrants
11	.

1	At
2	least
3	,
4	they
5	both
6	speak
7	with
8	strong
9	accents
10	,
11	as
12	do
13	Jackie
14	and
15	Maddie
16	.

1	It
2	could
3	n't
4	be
5	more
6	obvious
7	that
8	``
9	Chicken
10	Soup
11	''
12	is
13	being
14	made
15	from
16	an
17	old
18	recipe
19	.

1	And
2	a
3	safe
4	one
5	--
6	imagine
7	if
8	the
9	romance
10	in
11	question
12	were
13	between
14	an
15	Orthodox
16	Jew
17	and
18	a
19	member
20	of
21	the
22	Nation
23	of
24	Islam
25	.

1	Back
2	in
3	the
4	1920s
5	,
6	the
7	play
8	and
9	movie
10	versions
11	of
12	``
13	Abie
14	's
15	Irish
16	Rose
17	''
18	made
19	the
20	theme
21	of
22	courtship
23	between
24	the
25	assimilated
26	offspring
27	of
28	Jewish
29	and
30	Irish
31	immigrants
32	so
33	popular
34	that
35	its
36	author
37	,
38	Anne
39	Nichols
40	,
41	lost
42	a
43	plagiarism
44	suit
45	on
46	the
47	grounds
48	that
49	the
50	plot
51	has
52	entered
53	the
54	public
55	domain
56	.

1	And
2	it
3	has
4	remained
5	there
6	,
7	as
8	evidenced
9	by
10	its
11	reappearance
12	in
13	a
14	1972
15	CBS
16	sitcom
17	called
18	``
19	Bridget
20	Loves
21	Bernie
22	,
23	''
24	whose
25	sole
26	distinction
27	was
28	that
29	it
30	led
31	to
32	the
33	real-life
34	marriage
35	of
36	Meredith
37	Baxter
38	and
39	David
40	Birney
41	.

1	Clearly
2	,
3	the
4	question
5	with
6	``
7	Chicken
8	Soup
9	''
10	is
11	not
12	whether
13	the
14	pot
15	will
16	boil
17	over
18	,
19	but
20	whether
21	it
22	will
23	simmer
24	at
25	all
26	.

1	So
2	far
3	,
4	the
5	bubbles
6	have
7	been
8	few
9	and
10	far
11	between
12	.

1	Part
2	of
3	the
4	problem
5	is
6	the
7	tendency
8	of
9	all
10	sitcoms
11	,
12	ever
13	since
14	the
15	didactic
16	days
17	of
18	Norman
19	Lear
20	,
21	to
22	preach
23	about
24	social
25	issues
26	.

1	To
2	some
3	extent
4	,
5	this
6	tendency
7	emerges
8	whenever
9	the
10	show
11	tries
12	to
13	enlighten
14	us
15	about
16	ethnic
17	stereotypes
18	by
19	reversing
20	them
21	.

1	For
2	instance
3	,
4	Michael
5	dislikes
6	Jackie
7	not
8	because
9	he
10	's
11	a
12	shrewd
13	Jewish
14	businessman
15	,
16	but
17	because
18	he
19	quits
20	his
21	well-paying
22	job
23	as
24	a
25	salesman
26	in
27	order
28	to
29	become
30	a
31	social
32	worker
33	.

1	Even
2	more
3	problematic
4	is
5	the
6	incompatibility
7	between
8	sitcom
9	preachiness
10	and
11	Mr.
12	Mason
13	's
14	comic
15	persona
16	.

1	The
2	best
3	moments
4	in
5	the
6	show
7	occur
8	at
9	the
10	beginning
11	and
12	the
13	end
14	(
15	and
16	occasionally
17	in
18	the
19	middle
20	)
21	,
22	when
23	Mr.
24	Mason
25	slips
26	into
27	his
28	standup
29	mode
30	and
31	starts
32	meting
33	out
34	that
35	old-fashioned
36	Jewish
37	mischief
38	to
39	other
40	people
41	as
42	well
43	as
44	to
45	himself
46	.

1	But
2	too
3	often
4	,
5	these
6	routines
7	lack
8	spark
9	because
10	this
11	sitcom
12	,
13	like
14	all
15	sitcoms
16	,
17	is
18	timid
19	about
20	confronting
21	Mr.
22	Mason
23	's
24	stock
25	in
26	trade
27	-
28	ethnic
29	differences
30	.

1	I
2	'm
3	not
4	suggesting
5	that
6	the
7	producers
8	start
9	putting
10	together
11	episodes
12	about
13	topics
14	like
15	the
16	Catholic-Jewish
17	dispute
18	over
19	the
20	Carmelite
21	convent
22	at
23	Auschwitz
24	.

1	That
2	issue
3	,
4	like
5	racial
6	tensions
7	in
8	New
9	York

1	Another
2	big
3	question
4	hovering
5	over
6	the
7	debate
8	is
9	what
10	President

13	.

1	He
2	has
3	been
4	resisting
5	a
6	stripped-down

9	a
10	guaranteed
11	vote
12	on
13	his
14	capital-gains
15	tax
16	cut
17	.

1	But
2	Republican
3	senators
4	saw
5	no
6	way
7	to

9	a
10	procedural
11	hurdle
12	and
13	garner
14	the

19	win
20	the
21	capital-gains
22	issue
23	on
24	the
25	floor
26	,
27	so
28	they
29	went
30	ahead
31	with
32	the
33	streamlined
34	bill
35	.

1	The
2	Senate
3	bill
4	was
5	stripped
6	of
7	many
8	popular
9	,
10	though
11	revenue-losing
12	,
13	provisions
14	,
15	a
16	number
17	of
18	which
19	are
20	included
21	in
22	the
23	House-passed
24	bill
25	.

1	These
2	include
3	a
4	child-care
5	initiative
6	and
7	extensions
8	of
9	soon-to-expire
10	tax
11	breaks
12	for
13	low-income
14	housing
15	and
16	research-and-development
17	expenditures
18	.

1	Also
2	missing
3	from
4	the
5	Senate
6	bill
7	is
8	the
9	House
10	's
11	repeal
12	of
13	a
14	law
15	,
16	called
17	Section

19	,
20	that
21	compels

3	provision
4	that
5	was
6	originally
7	in

10	bill
11	but
12	was
13	cut

1	To
2	the
3	delight
4	of
5	some

7	,
8	the
9	bill
10	dropped

1	Sen.

4	that
5	the

7	required
8	sacrifice
9	by
10	every
11	senator
12	.

1	It
2	worked
3	,
4	others
5	said
6	,
7	because
8	there
9	were
10	no
11	exceptions
12	:
13	all
14	revenue-losing
15	provisions
16	were

18	.

1	The

3	also
4	dropped
5	a
6	plan
7	by
8	its
9	Finance
10	Committee
11	that

13	have
14	increased

14	%
15	excise
16	tax
17	on

1	It
2	no

4	includes
5	a

10	repealed
11	what

13	of
14	the

31	.

1	It

24	alleging
25	:

1	1
2	.
3	That
4	your
5	Sept.
6	28
7	editorial
8	``
9	Kangaroo
10	Committees
11	''
12	was
13	factually
14	inaccurate
15	and
16	deliberately
17	misleading
18	.

1	I
2	thought
3	your
4	editorial
5	was
6	factually
7	accurate
8	and
9	deliberately
10	elucidative
11	.

1	2
2	.
3	That
4	Mr.
5	Lantos
6	supported
7	the
8	rights
9	of
10	the
11	witnesses
12	to
13	take
14	the
15	Fifth
16	Amendment
17	.

1	Yes
2	,
3	he
4	did
5	.

1	As
2	I
3	watched
4	him
5	on
6	C-Span
7	,
8	I
9	heard
10	him
11	speak
12	those
13	lovely
14	words
15	about
16	the
17	Bill
18	of
19	Rights
20	,
21	which
22	he
23	quotes
24	from
25	the
26	transcript
27	of
28	the
29	hearings
30	.

1	He
2	did
3	repeat
4	those
5	nice
6	platitudes
7	several
8	times
9	as
10	an
11	indication
12	of
13	his
14	support
15	for
16	the
17	Constitution
18	.

1	He
2	used
3	about
4	56
5	words
6	defending
7	the
8	witnesses
9	'
10	constitutional
11	rights
12	.

1	Unfortunately
2	,
3	by
4	my
5	rough
6	guess
7	,
8	he
9	used
10	better
11	than
12	5,000
13	words
14	heaping
15	scorn
16	on
17	the
18	witnesses
19	for
20	exercising
21	the
22	Fifth
23	.

1	He
2	sandwiched
3	his
4	praise
5	of
6	constitutional
7	meat
8	between
9	large
10	loaves
11	of
12	bilious
13	commentary
14	.

1	As
2	your
3	editorial

7	criterion
8	,
9	Mr.
10	Lantos

15	a
16	whole
17	bunch
18	of
19	people
20	tried
21	and
22	convicted
23	.

1	Apparently
2	,
3	their
4	verdict
5	is
6	in
7	.

1	Right
2	now
3	they
4	're
5	pursuing
6	evidence

1	That
2	's
3	not
4	a
5	bad
6	way
7	to
8	proceed
9	,
10	just
11	somewhat
12	different
13	from
14	standard
15	American
16	practice
17	.

1	How
2	was
3	that
4	practice
5	referred
6	to
7	when
8	I
9	was

1	Ah
2	,
3	yes
4	,

6	called

9	Chamber
10	.

1	Of
2	course
3	,
4	Mr.
5	Lantos
6	doth
7	protest
8	that
9	his
10	subcommittee
11	simply
12	seeks
13	information
14	for
15	legislative
16	change
17	.

1	No
2	doubt
3	that
4	's
5	partially
6	true
7	.

1	Everything
2	that
3	Mr.
4	Lantos
5	says
6	in
7	his
8	letter
9	is
10	partially
11	true
12	.

1	He
2	's
3	right
4	about
5	his
6	subcommittee
7	's
8	responsibilities
9	when
10	it
11	comes
12	to
13	obtaining
14	information
15	from
16	prior
17	HUD
18	officials
19	.

1	But
2	if
3	his
4	explanation
5	of
6	motivation
7	is
8	true
9	,
10	why
11	is
12	his
13	investigation
14	so
15	oriented
16	as
17	to
18	identify
19	criminal

1	Such

1	The
2	problem
3	,
4	which
5	the
6	Journal
7	so
8	rightly
9	pointed
10	out
11	in
12	a
13	number
14	of
15	articles
16	,
17	is
18	not
19	the
20	likes
21	of
22	Mr.
23	Lantos
24	,
25	who
26	after
27	all
28	is
29	really
30	a
31	bit
32	player
33	on
34	the
35	stage
36	,
37	but
38	the
39	attempt
40	by
41	Congress
42	to
43	enhance
44	itself
45	into
46	a
47	quasi-parliamentary/judicial
48	body
49	.

1	(
2	Of
3	course
4	,
5	we
6	've
7	also
8	got
9	a
10	judiciary
11	that
12	seeks
13	the
14	same
15	objective
16	.
17	)

1	The
2	system
3	is
4	the
5	problem
6	,
7	not
8	an
9	individual
10	member
11	.

1	Individuals
2	can
3	always
4	have
5	their
6	hands
7	slapped
8	.

1	It
2	's
3	when
4	such
5	slapping
6	does
7	n't
8	occur
9	that
10	we
11	've
12	got
13	trouble
14	.

1	I
2	do
3	not
4	by
5	any
6	means
7	defend
8	HUD
9	management
10	.

1	But
2	I
3	think
4	the
5	kind
6	of
7	congressional
8	investigation
9	that
10	has
11	been
12	pursued
13	is
14	a
15	far
16	greater
17	danger
18	to
19	American
20	notions
21	of
22	liberty
23	and
24	freedom
25	than
26	any
27	incompetency
28	(
29	and
30	,
31	yes
32	,
33	maybe
34	criminality
35	)
36	within
37	HUD
38	could
39	possibly
40	generate
41	.

1	The
2	last
3	time
4	I
5	saw
6	a
7	similar

1	This

13	a
14	criminal
15	defendant

1	Thus
2	,
3	in

7	,
8	a
9	prosecutor
10	can
11	not

1	The

3	,

1	The

1	--
2	The
3	administration
4	has
5	sent
6	out
7	confusing
8	signals
9	about
10	its
11	response
12	to
13	a
14	recent
15	spate
16	of
17	airline
18	takeovers
19	.

1	Last
2	month
3	,
4	Transportation
5	Secretary
6	Sam
7	Skinner
8	forced
9	Northwest
10	Airlines
11	to
12	reduce
13	a
14	stake
15	held
16	by
17	KLM
18	Royal
19	Dutch
20	Airlines
21	.

1	But
2	he
3	has
4	since
5	run
6	into
7	opposition
8	from
9	the
10	Treasury
11	and
12	the
13	White
14	House
15	over
16	that
17	decision
18	.

1	And
2	he
3	has
4	kept
5	mum
6	on
7	how
8	his
9	decision
10	might
11	affect
12	a
13	bid
14	for
15	United
16	Airlines
17	,
18	which
19	includes
20	a
21	big
22	stake
23	by
24	British
25	Airways
26	PLC
27	.

1	Some
2	analysts
3	say
4	uncertainty
5	about
6	Washington
7	's
8	anti-takeover
9	policy
10	was
11	one
12	reason
13	that
14	financing
15	for
16	the
17	United
18	Airlines
19	takeover
20	fell
21	through
22	--
23	the
24	event
25	that
26	triggered
27	the
28	market
29	drop
30	.

1	In
2	many
3	ways
4	,
5	the
6	backdrop
7	to
8	Friday
9	's
10	stock
11	decline
12	is
13	eerily
14	similar
15	to
16	that
17	of
18	October
19	1987
20	's
21	508-point
22	crash
23	.

1	Then
2	,
3	as
4	now
5	,
6	the
7	budget
8	debate
9	was
10	behind
11	schedule
12	and
13	automatic
14	spending
15	cuts
16	were
17	within
18	days
19	of
20	taking
21	hold
22	.

1	The
2	Treasury
3	was
4	locked
5	in
6	a
7	battle
8	over
9	international
10	economic
11	policy
12	,
13	although
14	at
15	that
16	time
17	it
18	was
19	with
20	West
21	German
22	officials
23	rather
24	than
25	the
26	Federal
27	Reserve
28	.

1	And
2	concern
3	about
4	official
5	actions
6	aimed
7	at
8	takeovers
9	--
10	then
11	by
12	the
13	tax-writing
14	House
15	Ways
16	and
17	Means
18	Committee
19	rather
20	than
21	the
22	Transportation
23	Department
24	--
25	were
26	making
27	markets
28	nervous
29	.

1	The
2	1987
3	crash
4	brought
5	the
6	Reagan
7	administration
8	and
9	Democratic
10	lawmakers
11	to
12	the
13	table
14	for
15	the
16	first
17	budget
18	summit
19	,
20	resulting
21	in
22	a
23	two-year
24	plan
25	to
26	reduce
27	the
28	deficit
29	by
30	more
31	than
32	$
33	76
34	billion
35	--
36	even
37	though
38	the
39	deficit
40	actually
41	rose
42	by
43	nearly
44	$
45	12
46	billion
47	during
48	that
49	period
50	.

1	But
2	,
3	barring
4	further
5	drops
6	in
7	the
8	market
9	this
10	week
11	,
12	a
13	similar
14	outcome
15	does
16	n't
17	seem
18	likely
19	this
20	year
21	.

1	Lawmakers
2	and
3	administration
4	officials
5	agree
6	that
7	Friday
8	's
9	drop
10	,
11	by
12	itself
13	,
14	is
15	n't
16	enough
17	to
18	force
19	both
20	sides
21	back
22	to
23	the
24	table
25	to
26	try
27	to
28	reach
29	a
30	deficit-reduction
31	agreement
32	that
33	would
34	be
35	more
36	serious
37	and
38	more
39	far-reaching
40	than
41	last
42	spring
43	's
44	gimmick-ridden
45	plan
46	,
47	which
48	still
49	is
50	n't
51	fully
52	implemented
53	.

1	One
2	of
3	the
4	biggest
5	reasons
6	that
7	new
8	talks
9	are
10	n't
11	likely
12	to
13	come
14	about
15	is
16	that
17	,
18	as
19	everyone
20	learned
21	in
22	1987
23	,
24	the
25	economy
26	and
27	the
28	market
29	can
30	survive
31	a
32	one-day
33	508-point
34	tumble
35	.

1	``

1	Nevertheless
2	,
3	Tandem
4	faces
5	a
6	variety
7	of
8	challenges
9	,
10	the
11	biggest
12	being
13	that
14	customers

16	view

11	he

13	.

1	Do
2	n't
3	jump
4	yet
5	.

1	The
2	stock
3	market
4	's
5	swoon
6	may
7	turn
8	out
9	to
10	be
11	good
12	news
13	for
14	the

16	.

1	In
2	one
3	wild
4	hour
5	of
6	trading
7	,
8	the
9	market
10	managed
11	to
12	accomplish
13	what
14	the
15	Bush
16	administration
17	has
18	been
19	trying
20	to
21	do
22	,
23	unsuccessfully
24	,
25	for
26	weeks
27	.

1	It
2	is
3	forcing
4	the
5	Federal
6	Reserve
7	to
8	ease
9	its
10	grip
11	on
12	credit
13	and
14	it
15	took
16	the
17	wind
18	out
19	of
20	a
21	previously
22	irrepressible
23	dollar
24	.

1	The
2	resulting
3	decline
4	in
5	interest
6	rates
7	and
8	the
9	value
10	of
11	the
12	dollar
13	could
14	reinvigorate
15	American
16	business
17	--
18	indeed
19	,
20	the
21	entire
22	economy
23	.

1	This
2	may
3	sound
4	strangely
5	optimistic
6	.

1	After
2	all
3	,
4	until
5	a
6	few
7	years
8	ago
9	,
10	the
11	stock
12	market
13	was
14	viewed
15	as
16	a
17	barometer
18	of
19	the
20	national
21	economy
22	.

1	When
2	it
3	went
4	down
5	,
6	by
7	all
8	tradition
9	,
10	the
11	economy
12	followed
13	.

1	That
2	has
3	changed
4	,
5	partly
6	because
7	the
8	two
9	years
10	following
11	the
12	worst
13	stock-market
14	plunge
15	in

17	have
18	been
19	reasonably
20	comfortable

20	the
21	U.S.

1	The
2	financial-services

10	.

1	What

4	,
5	although

10	far
11	less

13	today
14	than
15	two

19	the

2	if
3	the

8	continue

11	,
12	the

15	of
16	lower
17	interest

19	and
20	a

1	Fed

10	mean

13	change
14	in

1	But
2	the
3	experience
4	of
5	the
6	1987
7	crash
8	suggests
9	the
10	Fed
11	is
12	likely
13	to
14	bring
15	down
16	short-term
17	interest

1	Tiny

9	what
10	banks
11	charge
12	each

28	leaves

32	markets
33	.

1	The
2	dollar
3	also
4	began
5	to
6	decline
7	Friday
8	as
9	the
10	stock
11	market
12	's
13	plunge
14	caused
15	some
16	investors
17	to
18	reassess
19	their
20	desire
21	to
22	invest
23	in
24	the
25	U.S.
26	.

1	Treasury
2	officials
3	have
4	been
5	arguing
6	for
7	months
8	that
9	the
10	dollar
11	's
12	strength
13	was
14	out
15	of
16	whack
17	with
18	economic
19	fundamentals
20	,
21	threatening
22	to
23	extinguish
24	the
25	export
26	boom
27	that
28	has
29	sustained
30	manufacturers
31	for
32	several
33	years
34	.

1	The
2	market
3	drop
4	has
5	now
6	apparently
7	convinced
8	foreign
9	investors
10	that
11	the
12	Treasury
13	was
14	right
15	about
16	the
17	overpriced
18	dollar
19	.

1	A
2	modest
3	drop
4	in
5	the
6	dollar
7	--
8	only
9	a
10	modest
11	one
12	,
13	mind
14	you
15	--
16	would
17	be
18	welcomed
19	by
20	the
21	U.S.
22	.

1	That
2	was
3	n't
4	the
5	case
6	in
7	1987
8	,
9	when
10	the
11	dollar
12	was
13	so
14	weak
15	that
16	some
17	economists
18	and
19	government
20	officials
21	seriously
22	worried
23	that
24	it
25	might
26	collapse
27	,
28	producing
29	panic
30	among
31	foreign
32	investors
33	and
34	diminishing
35	the
36	flow
37	of
38	foreign
39	capital
40	to
41	the
42	U.S.
43	.

1	Another
2	big
3	difference
4	between
5	1987
6	and
7	1989
8	is
9	n't
10	so
11	comforting
12	.

1	In
2	the
3	third
4	quarter
5	of
6	1987
7	,
8	the
9	economy
10	spurted
11	at
12	an
13	inflation-adjusted
14	annual
15	rate
16	of
17	5.3
18	%
19	.

1	The
2	consensus
3	among
4	economists
5	is
6	that
7	it
8	grew
9	a
10	much
11	more
12	sluggish
13	2.3
14	%
15	in
16	the
17	third
18	quarter

23	ended

1	But
2	,
3	in
4	the
5	process
6	,
7	the
8	Fed
9	risks
10	reigniting
11	inflation
12	.

1	Even
2	before
3	Friday
4	's
5	events
6	,
7	Harvard
8	University
9	economist
10	Benjamin
11	Friedman
12	was
13	arguing
14	that
15	the

17	wo
18	n't
19	be
20	able
21	to
22	live
23	up
24	to
25	its
26	tough
27	words
28	on
29	eliminating
30	inflation
31	because
32	of
33	its
34	responsibility
35	to
36	protect
37	fragile
38	financial
39	markets
40	,
41	banks
42	and
43	highly
44	leveraged
45	corporations
46	.

1	The
2	biggest
3	threat
4	on
5	the
6	economic
7	horizon
8	right
9	now
10	is
11	n't
12	recession
13	,
14	he
15	reasons
16	;
17	it
18	's
19	an
20	outbreak
21	of
22	uncontrolled
23	inflation
24	.

1	In
2	the
3	end
4	,
5	the
6	1987
7	collapse
8	suggested
9	,
10	the
11	economy
12	does
13	n't
14	move
15	in
16	lockstep
17	with
18	stock
19	prices
20	.

1	The
2	economy
3	does
4	,
5	however
6	,
7	depend
8	on
9	the
10	confidence
11	of
12	businesses
13	,
14	consumers
15	and
16	foreign
17	investors
18	.

1	A
2	panic
3	on
4	Wall
5	Street
6	does
7	n't
8	exactly
9	inspire
10	confidence
11	.

1	Surveys
2	suggested
3	that
4	consumer
5	confidence
6	was
7	high
8	before
9	Friday
10	.

1	A
2	190-point
3	drop
4	is
5	n't
6	likely
7	to
8	make
9	much
10	of
11	a
12	dent
13	;
14	multiply
15	that
16	a
17	few
18	times
19	over
20	,
21	though
22	,
23	and
24	it
25	will
26	.

1	If
2	the
3	reactions
4	of
5	executives
6	gathered
7	Saturday
8	at
9	Hot
10	Springs
11	,
12	Va.
13	,
14	for
15	the
16	Business
17	Council
18	meetings
19	are
20	typical
21	,
22	business
23	leaders
24	were
25	n't
26	overly
27	rattled
28	by
29	Friday
30	's
31	decline
32	.

1	And
2	if
3	foreign
4	investors
5	become
6	a
7	tad
8	more
9	cautious
10	--
11	well
12	,
13	the
14	dollar
15	's
16	recent
17	strength
18	suggests
19	that
20	the
21	U.S.
22	can
23	stand
24	it
25	.

1	On
2	the
3	bottom
4	line
5	,
6	the
7	most
8	comforting
9	fact
10	for
11	the
12	economic
13	outlook
14	is
15	that
16	we
17	've

1	The

1	The

5	Black
6	Monday
7	permits
8	a
9	more
10	optimistic

1	At

6	the
